# Lift-control-scheme-with-PLC
Project realized for the course of Control Systems at the "Università di Bologna"
## INTRODUCTION
An elevator is, nowadays, a machine that can be found either in the newest skyscraper or in a little city building. Nonetheless the functioning in these two situations can be quite similar. One fundamental component in order to achieve the right behavior of the lift is a good Logic Controller.
Our project tries to achieve this objective using the SFC language jointly with ST language, all implemented in the Codesys environment.
The project has four GAs (DoorGA, MotorGA, VelocityGA and CalculationGA) commanded by a Policy.
